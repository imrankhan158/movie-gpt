Movie GPT is a movie recommendation system that uses OpenAI's ChatGPT to provide movie recommendations based on user search prompts. It fetches movie data from TMDb (The Movie Database) and presents relevant movie suggestions to users. Firebase is used for authentication to enhance user experience.

## Features

- **Movie Recommendations**: Receive personalized movie recommendations based on your input.
- **TMDb Integration**: Fetch up-to-date movie information and details from TMDb.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure and user-friendly authentication powered by Firebase.
- **React with Redux Toolkit**: Built with React and Redux Toolkit for efficient state management.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
